Project: Recipes from TheOdinProject

For this project, I wanted to create a 4-page website. One with a homepage and 3 recipes. All the pages needed to link to one another, have images, and have a link to the original recipe. 

In doing this I demonstrate my ability to work with an HTML boilerplate, use headings, <em> and <a>, and place images on the page.
